"""
buggy-service — a deliberately broken Lambda for the Patchwork demo.

The handler processes an incoming "order" event and computes a shipping
quote. It contains a REAL, diagnosable bug: it assumes every order has a
`customer.address`, but guest checkouts send `customer: null`. On that
input the function raises, and we log the full traceback as structured
JSON so the downstream Strands agent has genuine source + stack to work
from.

The bug, root cause, and fix hint are documented inline so we can later
verify the agent reached the right conclusion.
